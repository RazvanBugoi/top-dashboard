# Dashboard
This is the second project from The Odin Project Intermidiate HTML and CSS course.  <br />
You can try it live here: https://razvanbugoi.github.io/top-dashboard/src/index.html <br />
Please note that this is not mobile responsive as this was not a requirement.


## Objective
The idea behind this project is to get myself comfortable using CSS Grid layout. 


## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS


## The process and outcome
The first step I took was to create some HTML dummy content and define the overall layout of the page with CSS Grid. <br />
After this, I had three main sections that needed expanding upon (the sidebar, the header, and the main content). <br />
I went ahead and tackled one section at a time by creating HTML content first, and then adding the necessary styles to position the elements properly and make them look nice. <br />
The final step was to add check that for mistakes and to upload the project on Github pages. <br />
The project took me a good few days' worths of work, but I am pleased to have improved my CSS and HTML knowledge by the end of it.
